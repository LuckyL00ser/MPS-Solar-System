# MPS-Solar-System
University project for "Modelling of Physical Systems" - planetary system simulation.

* Should Sun rotate around center of the mass or not
* Clearly define equations that will be used


## To do
* initial conditions file from which planets are built(separate files for planets/asteroids?)
* class describing planet
	* method to print current planet position to a file
	* metod to generate new accelerations and velocities
	* method to generate 
* function that calculates center of mass for given list of planets / asteroids
* function / class to show final results
	* scaling of simulation speed
	* scaling simulation size
